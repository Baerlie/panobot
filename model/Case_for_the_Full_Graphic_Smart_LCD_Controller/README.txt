# Summary

This is a case for the Full Graphic Smart LCD Controller. http://www.reprapdiscount.com/home/34-full-graphic-smart-lcd-controller.html

# Instructions

As on my other enclosures: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35438  
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:79820  
I tried to design a slim enclosure again using a channel outside between the top and bottom part to let the case apear more flat - and, to cover possible impressisions ;-).  
I recommend to print the parts in different colors.   
To fasten the controller board to the bottom part, first put the distance cylinders between the boards and use metrical screws M3 x 12 (14).  
Both will work without tapping before.   
There is no room for hexagonal pockets in the top part. You can screw M3 x 16 directly into it.  
The second bottom part contains several screw nut deepenings for fastening the case as you like. If you mount it to an 8 mm rod you can use the case clamps.  
If the cables are plugged in, the case inevitably has a slope of 6Â°. In case you need more slope:   
I'm already thinking about a base that can be screwed below the housing.  
If you are interested, look out for this thing which I will publish separated.  
   
And yes, don't forget to assemble the distance cylinders - the display's bord won't like it ;-)
